    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg (about 3 lbs) beef short ribs</li>
        <li>1 small Korean radish (or daikon), about 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 medium size onion</li>
        <li>12 cups water</li>
        <li>Starch noodles (optional)</li>
        <li>4 cloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>4 to 6 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the beef short ribs in cold water a couple of times to remove any residual blood and bone fragments. Soak in cold water.
        </li>
        <li>Drain the ribs and blanch in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain the ribs. Wash each one thoroughly and remove any visible fat. Clean the pot, too.</li>
        <li>Put the clean ribs back into the pot and add radish, onion, and 12 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium high heat for 1 hour, and then lower the heat to medium and boil for another 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat. Discard the onion and put the ribs and radish into a stainless steel bowl.</li>
        <li>Strain the broth through a cheesecloth in a strainer. Put the clear broth back into the pot and remove any floating fat with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Add about 1 cup of starch noodles and the minced garlic. Bring to a boil for a few minutes until the noodles are cooked. Taste a sample to check: they should be soft yet firm, with nothing hard inside.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat.</li>
    </ol>
