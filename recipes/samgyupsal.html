    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>14-16 green onions (about 5 cups), sliced thinly</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your grill plate or pan. Put a little toasted sesame oil on the hot plate for flavor.</li>
        <li>Cover the grill plate with pork belly. Grill them and turn them over when the bottoms get a little crispy.
            Keep cooking and turning them over until both sides are crispy.</li>
        <li>As the pieces get ready to eat, take them off the grill and put them on a small side plate. People can take
            the pieces from this plate, or if theyâ€™re too hungry they can take them right off the grill!</li>
        <li>Eat, but keep cooking!</li>
    </ol>
